# pythoven
A music maker module for Windows. 

Instructions: 

To run, download the .py script and save it in a directory. 

Go to the directory in Command Prompt or PowerShell and run: 

pythonw [script].py

It MUST be pythonw or the sound will not play. 

A Linux version will come soon.

Concept: 

My very first Python program was written about 15 years ago. It used Winsound beeps to play Mary Had a Little Lamb. 

Since then, I've learned how to use variables and dictionaries. 

I decided to revisit the original program's concept, and update it with what I've learned. 

Each note has been assigned a precise hertz (Hz) and the scale is tuned to middle C. 

In the future, I plan on creating a simple interface with TKinter that will allow users to play notes by clicking on a button. I also plan on creating a way to record songs.
